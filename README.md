- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @wsirota
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in becoming a more awesome guitar player and relaying knowledge from a career in programming to others if/when it is useful. Also in the next generation
of cross-platform music self-education apps (and music generators, for art's sake).
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to help programmers learn just enough git in 15 minutes
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: DM @warrensirota on Twitter

I'm a geezer who's seen a lot - from punched cards through microservices. Worked for banks, energy companies, consulting firms. Also designed, created, and published a (fairly minor, but high-quality) app 
called SlowGold that has helped tens of thousands of musicians learn to play better, and written columns for both music and computer magazines (when 
print was a thing). Currently much more focused on guitar than programming, but still enjoy observing the landscape - especially the way the Holy Grail of really good 
cross-platform development finally becomes possible with things like Web Assembly and various Js UI frameworks that can run natively on many platforms, like rRact.
